</ul>

<strong>2.41</strong> <em>(11-May-09)</em>:
<ul>

<li>Changed the automatic keystroke to paste the letter out of the clipboard. <tt>Shift+Insert</tt> is now
used instead as <tt>Ctrl+V</tt> appears to cause some problems in a few non European keymaps.</li>
</ul>

<strong>2.22</strong> <em>(07-May-09)</em>:

<li>Recompiled the help files to a single .chm file.</li>
</ul>

<li>Added the "Automatic aŭ/eŭ" option.</li>

<tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Run \ Tajpi</tt>.</li>
<li>Added the "Hotkey" to activate/deactivate the program.</li>
<li>Created an installer for the program with <a href="http://www.innosetup.com/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>. The product is now
