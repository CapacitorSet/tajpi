<em>Tajpi</em> - Esperanto Keyboard<br />
for Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7
</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
In the Esperanto alphabet there are six diacritical letters which cannot be typed with regular Windows keyboard layouts.
Tajpi is a program that lets you type these letters with ease and without modifying your system keymap.
Tajpi (pronounced "thai pea") means "to type" in Esperanto.
</p>
<p>
With Tajpi running you can enter combinations like like sx, gh, ^u and others, and they will be automatically replaced
by the appropriate Esperanto letter. You can also configure your keyboard so that an Esperanto letter appears immediately
when pressing a certain key, simulating a keyboard remap. It's also possible to use <tt>Alt Gr</tt>
or simulate the "dead keys" which exist in many standard keyboard layouts. Tajpi also has a basic scripting language
providing more advanced configuration, as well as utilities to convert to and from the so-called X-system or input
any Unicode character upon pressing a configured keystroke.
</p>
<p>
While Tajpi is running an icon sits in the notification area (system tray) which shows the status of the program.
Tajpi will make absolutely no changes to your system; it just sits in the background and responds to keyboard input.
</p>
<p>
Tajpi is free software, published with its source code under the conditions of the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>
version 3.
